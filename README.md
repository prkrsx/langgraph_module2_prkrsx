# Module 2: Lesson 1 - State Schema
1. Learnt how to use typed state schemas (specifically TypedDict, dataclass, and Pydantic models) to ensure that every node in the LangGraph structure shares a consistent data structure.
2. This makes the overall graph more predictable and easier to manage.
3. The existing "mood" channel has been renamed to the "feeling".
4. Using values like "overwhelmed" or "underwhelmed" to represent the state or mood.
